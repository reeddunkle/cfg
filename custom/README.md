## Restore your backup

If you want to remove my config and restore your backup, follow these steps.

1.  Close TF2
1.  Delete the `reed-config` folder inside of your `custom` folder.
1.  Replace your current `cfg` folder with the backup of your `cfg` folder.
1.  Ensure that you have more than one copy of your backup. (E-mail it to yourself or upload it somewhere.)
1.  Inside of your `cfg` folder, create a copy of the file `config.cfg` and call it `restore_config.cfg`.
1.  Restart TF2 and go into a custom server.
1.  Open the console and type `exec restore_config` and press Enter.

Test out your keys and settings to ensure they're all working as expected. There's a good chance that one of the keys that my config changed won't have reverted correctly.

Here's a list of the keys that my config changes as of 3/1/2018.
